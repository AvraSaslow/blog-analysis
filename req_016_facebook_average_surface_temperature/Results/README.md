This folder contains the results of analysis done in [req_016_facebook_average_surface_temperature](https://github.com/resource-watch/blog-analysis/tree/master/req_016_facebook_average_surface_temperature),
which contains average monthly and annual surface temperature in degrees Celsius from 1950 through 2019 for four countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, at the national and state level.

Each file is a CSV that can be opened in Excel or another text reader, and there is a separate file for each country and level (i.e. a separate file for the national level average and the state level average).
Each file contains the ISO code of the country, Germany (DEU), the United Kingdom (GBR), the United States (USA), and France (FRA).
The first couple of columns are descriptive of the country or states such as official name and ISO codes.

Next are the average temperature measurements with the date as the column header. 
For example in the monthly files, the column headers are the Year-Month-Day (e.g. 1956-12-1 for December 1956's average monthly surface temperature). 
And in the yearly files, the column headers are the year (e.g. 1956 for 1956's average annual surface temperature). Finally there are separate rows for the national level results and the state level results. 

**All temperature values are reported in degrees Celsius.**
